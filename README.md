# Files Manager

This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files with the following features:

- User authentication via a token
- List all files
- Upload a new file
- Change permission of a file
- View a file
- Generate thumbnails for images

This project is largely guided with a step by step plan, however, there are some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc... (`utils` folder)

This kind of service already exists in the real world. It's simply a great learning opportunity to build something practical from start to finish using commonly used technologies. The goal is to have a useful and usable application by the end of this project that achieves the goals outlined above.
